# AssignmentCalculator
Academic Advising would like create an Assignment Calculator tool for their site. They;ve found an open source tool (from the U of MN) that was then rebuilt by another school and got have the PHP source code, I've attached that here:

Chad Kluck from the Libraries reviewed the project and installed a sample of it here:
https://sandbox.63klabs.net/libraries/Seneca_Assignment_Calculator/index.php

Plenty of other schools have used or adapted this same code, for example:
https://www.lib.umn.edu/ac

These folks added email reminders:
https://library.rit.edu/researchguides/calculator/email.php?monthone=7&dayone=17&yearone=2019&monthtwo=7&daytwo=22&yeartwo=2019&SubjectID=2


What I'd like to do is review the code and rewrite from php to javascript that can be included in page like other calculators we've worked on.

Macalester look like they have done something pretty close to this and added calendar links, etc.

The content especially and possibly logic for this will need to be revisited, but the basics for it are pretty straight forward. Staff from Advising and the Library should be able to help with the content changes once we've built out some of the logic.
